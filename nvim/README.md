## Here is the nvim config for Zicx.

### Two versions of nvim:
- [lua](https://github.com/Xuer04/Awesome-dotfiles/tree/main/nvim/lua): This config based on [lua](http://www.lua.org/home.html) script, which is faster, the plug manager is **Packer**.
- [vimscript](https://github.com/Xuer04/Awesome-dotfiles/tree/main/nvim/vimscript): This config based on vim script, which is simple and easier, the plug manager is **Vim-plug**.

If you meet some issues when using this config file, please contact [Zicx](https://github.com/Xuer04) or mention a [issues](https://github.com/Xuer04/Mydotfiles/issues).

Hoping you can enjoy neovim on your PC! ðŸ˜º
